Scaling & Polishing in Gurgaon – Kalyani Hospital

Scaling and polishing are essential preventive dental procedures used to maintain oral health and prevent gum disease. In Gurgaon, several dental clinics—including Kalyani Hospital—offer these services as part of routine dental care.

What Are They?

Scaling is the process of removing plaque and hardened tartar (calculus) from the surfaces of the teeth and around the gums. This often involves ultrasonic instruments and manual tools to reach both above and just below the gum line.

Polishing follows scaling: a gentle abrasive paste is applied with a rubber cup or brush to smooth the tooth surfaces, reduce staining, and make it more difficult for new plaque to adhere.

Why It Matters
Regular scaling and polishing help prevent gingivitis and periodontitis by eliminating bacterial deposits before they damage gum tissue. They also reduce bad breath, brighten the appearance of teeth by removing surface stains, and improve overall gum health by decreasing inflammation and bleeding.

Procedure at Kalyani Hospital
At Kalyani Hospital’s dental department, patients first get a thorough dental examination—including assessment of gum health, plaque buildup, and any signs of periodontal disease. Based on that, scaling is done using modern ultrasonic devices, complemented by manual instruments where necessary. Once the hard deposits are removed, the dentist polishes the teeth to render them smooth and clean. Because the hospital uses good sterilization practices and advanced tools, patients often experience minimal discomfort and faster recovery.

What to Expect After Treatment
After scaling and polishing, you may notice slight sensitivity or mild gum tenderness for a short period. Good oral hygiene—brushing gently, flossing, and using a mouthwash—is recommended. The dentist might advise follow-up visits every six months (or more frequently, depending on individual risk) to maintain gum health.

Cost Considerations in Gurgaon
The cost for scaling and polishing can vary depending on the degree of tartar buildup, the number of teeth involved, whether deep cleaning (below the gumline) is required, and the clinic’s standards. In Gurgaon, a standard scaling + polishing procedure generally falls in the mid-range bracket. At Kalyani Hospital—being a larger facility with quality infrastructure—the cost might be somewhat higher than small dental clinics, reflecting the use of advanced equipment and thorough protocols.
